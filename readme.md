More on Flexbox
React Native uses Flexbox to position elements and create layouts. It also uses a set of CSS properties you can use to style your elements.

One important thing to note is, that it uses Flexbox and these properties but that it doesn't really use CSS! You don't write real CSS code here, you still write everything in JavaScript.

Not even close to all CSS properties and features are supported therefore.

If you want to get a full list about the supported properties, the following cheat sheet will be useful to you: <a href="https://github.com/vhpoet/react-native-styling-cheat-sheet">https://github.com/vhpoet/react-native-styling-cheat-sheet</a>
